# compress-extract-system

Recently, I found my project that my data-structure homework in a dark corner. Therefore, I put it on the github. It's based on Huffman code, I tested it and found it can save 30%~50% capacity commonly for text document. And for aduio, picture or video, it's especial because their own algorithm. Therefore , they have very few data redundancy, and compress them is really beyond my capability.
